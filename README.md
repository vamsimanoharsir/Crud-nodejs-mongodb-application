# Crud-nodejs-mongodb-application
This application gives you the complete overview on how to work with crud operations. I have used postman tool to validate all the api endpoints. Before starting the project check all the db connections and give your local db information. Also install postman to validate all the api calls. All the routes are specified in a separate folder
